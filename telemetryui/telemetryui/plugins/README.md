## telemetrics-backend view plugins

### Overview

View plugins is a way to extend the available views in the telemetryui 
without modifying code in the core of the application. This is important
because custom modifications to the core could make difficult for users
to update their deployment with new releases.

Plugins provide a reasonable encapsulation/separation of the plugin logic 
and still allows the plugins to access core component i.e. base.html template.  


### How should plugins be encapsulated?

## Name
Plugin code should be in a folder with a descriptive name and it should be
[PEP8 module name](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) acceptable name.
Telemetryui view plugins are essentially [flask blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/blueprints/)
therefore a plugin can define its own resource folders (templates and static) that live
in the same folder as the rest of the plugin code (i.e.) 

```bash
plugin_root/
        views.py
        helpers.py
        templates/
                main.html
                snipet.html
        static/
              main.css
              main.js
```

Note that plugins are able to access templates declared at the app level. The flask templating
system will try to find a template initially in the list of templates registered by the main app.  


## Attributes required in a plugin view

Plugins are expected to have a views.py file with all the views that the plugin
provides (i.e.)

```bash
plugin_root/
            __init__.py
            views.py
            templates

```

Plugins are imported as python modules, therefore  ```__init__.py``` is required. 

views.py must have a variable with the name TAB_NAME, this is the name of the
tab that will be displayed on the telemetryui (i.e.)

```python
import os
...

TAB_NAME = "My Plugin"

...
```

views.py must have an init function with the following syntax:

```python

from flask import Blueprint

my_plugin = Blueprint('my_plugin', __name__) 

...

def init(fn):
    fn(my_plugin)

```

The init function is used to pass the blueprint to the core for registration.

To "install" a plugin into telemetryui copy the plugin folder to the plugins 
folder under telemetryui (i.e.)

```bash

cp my_plugin telemetrics-backend/telemetryui/plugins/my_plugin
``` 

un-comment the PLUGINS section of config (or config_local) and add your plugin to
the list (i.e.). 

```bash

class Config(object):
    DEBUG = True
    TESTING = False
    LOG_LEVEL = logging.ERROR
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/telemdb'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True
    LOG_FILE = 'telemetryui.log'
    WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True
    SECRET_KEY = 'a secret key'

    # Uncomment next line 
    PLUGINS = ['my_plugin']
```

Remember the plugin name is the name of the python module that was dropped
in the plugins folder in telemetryui.
